## How do electrical machine maintain voltage, active and reactive powers demands?  
   - Illustrate and explain the equivalenet circuit of a **synchronous machine**
   - Using the equivalent circuit, explain how its output ((terminal) voltage is affected by the  
     active and reactive power drawn by its connected load.
   - How is the terminal voltage maintained at various loading level?
   - How is its output frequency maintained at 50 or 60 Hz?
