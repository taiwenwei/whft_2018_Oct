## How do wind power generators produce energy at different wind speed conditions?  
   - How does a wind power generator harvest more energy from the wind if the wind speed is below its rated wind speed?
   - How does a wind power generator maintains it rated output power when the wind speed is larger than its rated wind speed?
   - How does a wind turbine shed extra power from the wind if the wind speed is very much larger than its rated wind speed?
   - Illustrate and explain the power curve of a wind power generator with active stall control?
   - Illustrate and explain the power curve of a wind power generator with passive stall control?
